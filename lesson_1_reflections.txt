How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed how the new file was different than the old one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Gives you an understanding of how program evolved.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Logical commit points. Easy to understand changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some are designed for projects with multiple related code files, while others are for documents that do not necessiarily have any relation.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to view the history of all changes. Use diff to view the differences between commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back to a previous working version and identify what was broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Source control.
